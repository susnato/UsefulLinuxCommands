GREP - 
grep -[option] keyword filename1 filename2 [grep susnato file1.txt file2.txt]
	-i = lower_case/upper_case
	-v = except that keyword
	-c = no of times that keyword appeared in the files
	-w = exact match
	-n = show the line number
	-h = suppress filename(while searching in multiple files)
	-e = to search multiple keywords(grep -e word1 -e word2 file1.txt file2.txt)
	-l = only show the filenames in which the keywords are present 
	-f = when searching for multiple keywords make a file and use -f filename.txt to search all words
	-R = to search recursively in a directory (grep -R susnato ./dir)
	-o = Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line, with each such part on  a  separate output line.(useful for vowel-consonents)
	^keyword = to search a keyword which starts with keyword
	keyword$ = to search a keyword which ends with keyword
	
EGREP - to search multiple files we use grep with -e "kw1" -e "kw2" and egrep does the same
egrep -[option] "keyword1|keyword2" f1.txt f2.txt

special cases - 
	-q = if you want to search but don't want to show the output (later can be viewed as echo $?)
	-s = in the above command any error will be shows(such as no directory named as dirA) to suppress that too use this with q so it will be qs
	-ls | grep file = to search between files and folders
